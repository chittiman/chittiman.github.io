Hi, I'm Sairam and this is my [tech blog](https://chittiman.github.io/). 
I wish to share my experiences and interesting discoveries while pursuing my craft in Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

I previously worked at Reverie Language Technologies in their NLP team, developing Neural Machine Translation models for Indian languages. Working in such a low-resource domain was a challenging yet highly enriching experience. I'm honored that my work is being utilized by the Indian Parliament, Income Tax department, and Ministry of HRD for their localization efforts.

While I am currently training models to learn language, in my previous role I was training students to learn Physics for IIT-JEE. This foundation in Physics helped me greatly in developing right intuitions and mental models in Deep Learning. In this journey, forever grateful to [Andrej karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC "CS231N") and [Chris Manning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z "CS224N") for sharing their knowledge with the world for free.

My favourite personal project - Developing [Transliteration models for Indian Languages](https://github.com/chittiman/Transliteration-App "Transliteration - Github") from scratch. Especially, writing code for Beam Search was super challenging and fun , especially for a newbie entering into the field

When I'm not geeking out on ML, you can catch me diving into food adventures â€“ be it reading, watching, or cooking up something tasty.
