## Introduction

Building effective neural translation models typically requires massive parallel datasets - a luxury most of the world's languages simply don't have. When the Indian Parliament initiated translation of proceedings into 22 regional languages, Maithili and Konkani presented the most fascinating challenge. With existing models barely scraping 0.3 BLEU scores, these extremely low-resource languages seemed nearly impossible to crack. By creating synthetic datasets and leveraging cross-lingual relationships, we pushed performance to 9.5+ BLEU - achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal resources. But why exactly were these languages so challenging to begin with?

## Problem Setup

To understand the scale of our challenge, consider the data landscape for English translation pairs: German has around 50 million sentence pairs, Hindi has roughly 5 million, while Tamil and Telugu have around 500,000 each. Assamese, already considered low-resource, has about 50,000 pairs. In comparison, Konkani had 5,000 parallel sentences available, and Maithili had 500.

Maithili, spoken in Bihar and Nepal, is linguistically related to Hindi, while Konkani, used in Goa and coastal areas, is connected to Marathi. These relationships offered potential for transfer learning. But the lack of native speakers internally, reliable benchmarks, and clean parallel data added challenges. However, all languages used Devanagari script, simplifying preprocessing. Before diving into our methods, it's worth understanding the encoder-decoder architecture that underlies modern NMT.
