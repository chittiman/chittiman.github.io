## Introduction

Building effective neural translation models typically requires massive parallel datasets - a luxury most of the world's languages simply don't have. When the Indian Parliament initiated translation of proceedings into 22 regional languages, Maithili and Konkani presented the most fascinating challenge. With existing models barely scraping 0.3 BLEU scores, these extremely low-resource languages seemed nearly impossible to crack. By creating synthetic datasets and leveraging cross-lingual relationships, we pushed performance to 9.5+ BLEU - achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal resources. But why exactly were these languages so challenging to begin with?

## Problem Setup

[General concepts and theory:
- What is tagged back-translation and why it's effective
- Cross-lingual transfer learning principles
- How neighboring languages (Hindi/Marathi) can help
- Synthetic data creation rationale]

## Adapting Techniques to Extreme Low-resource Settings

[Real-world implementation challenges and solutions:
